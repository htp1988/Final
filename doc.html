  <h1>Documentation: Medicaid Enrollment Trends (2014–2025)</h1>

  <p>
    This page describes how I designed my D3 visualization and what I learned from it.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Design Process</h2>
  <p>
    First, I loaded the dataset in a small D3 test file to see the columns and make
    sure there were no big problems. The data has state, total Medicaid enrollees,
    VIII group enrollees, newly eligible enrollees, and monthly dates from 2014 to 2025.
  </p>
  <p>
    Then I drew a few sketches on paper. My main ideas were:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>A line chart to show total Medicaid enrollment over time.</li>
    <li>A dropdown menu to choose any state.</li>
    <li>Two lines on the same chart: the selected state vs the national total.</li>
    <li>Options to switch the metric (total Medicaid, VIII group, newly eligible).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    After that, I built a simple D3 version with just one line, then added the second
    line, axes, and tooltips. I adjusted font sizes, margins, and spacing so that
    labels were not cut off. I also tested different colors to make sure the lines
    were easy to tell apart.
  </p>

  <p><strong>(Insert scanned sketches here.)</strong></p>

  <h2>2. Design Rationale</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Line chart:</strong> I used a line chart because the key question is how
    enrollment changes over time. A line makes increases and decreases easy to see.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Color choices:</strong> I used blue for the national total and orange for
    the selected state. These colors have good contrast and are still readable for
    people with mild color blindness.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Dropdown for state:</strong> Instead of showing many states at once, I
    used a dropdown. This keeps the chart clean and lets the user focus on one state
    at a time.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Metric selection:</strong> The Metric menu lets the user switch between
    total Medicaid enrollees, VIII group enrollees, and newly eligible enrollees.
    This uses the same chart layout but gives different views of the data.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Tooltips:</strong> Tooltips show the exact values for the state and the
    national total at a given month. This keeps the chart simple while still giving
    precise numbers when needed.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Findings from the Visualization</h2>
  <h3>Finding 1: National enrollment grows over time</h3>
  <p>
    When I choose the national total in the chart, the line shows a general upward
    trend in Medicaid enrollment from 2014 to 2025.
  </p>
  <p><strong>(Insert screenshot of national trend here.)</strong></p>

  <h3>Finding 2: States have different patterns</h3>
  <p>
    When I pick different states, I see that some states grow faster and some grow
    slower than the national line. Some states have clear jumps in enrollment around
    the time of expansion.
  </p>
  <p><strong>(Insert screenshot comparing one state vs national here.)</strong></p>

  <h3>Finding 3: Expansion (VIII group) is important</h3>
  <p>
    When I switch the metric to VIII group enrollees or newly eligible enrollees,
    expansion states show a large number of people in this group, especially in the
    early years after expansion. Non-expansion states show very small or zero values.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Demo Video</h2>
  <p>
    Below is my 2–4 minute screen-capture video. In the video I show how to use the
    visualization, how to change the state and metric, and I explain the main
    findings.
